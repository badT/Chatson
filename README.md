```
$ npm run build

$ npm run build:production
```
clean the `dist` folder and rebuilds the app for deployment
### Production
To run your server in production simply place the `index.html` and `dist` folder into
your `web root`.

In development mode the app uses `hashHistory` (e.g /#/home?_k=x928123) which
keeps track of your currently location on and the state of the page. It is adviced
for production to use `browserHistory` instead of `hashHistory`

To make this change edit `src/index.js`
```
// before change
...
import { Router, Redirect, hashHistory as history } from 'react-router';
...

// after change
...
import { Router, Redirect, browserHistory as history } from 'react-router';
...

```

the use of history push api requires that all your requests point to index.html
since react-router is keeping track of the navigation (e.g this can be done with `.htaccess` file at the web root or with `nginx` configuration)

## Run karma
```
$ npm test
```
